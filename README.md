# Dominance-based Rough Set Approach for Mixed Datatypes and the DOMLEM Algorithm

This package provides functions used in the DRSA, including:

- Upward and downward class unions
- P-dominating and P-dominated sets
- P-lower and P-upper approximations and boundary regions
- Upward and downward multi- and mega-unions
- Decision rules
- Rule support, certainty, strength, and coverage.

It supports multiple types of attributes, including indiscernibility, similarity, and dominance.

The package also provides an implementation of the DOMLEM algorithm for extracting decision rules consistent with the dominance principle.

## Getting started

The best place to get started with using this packages is one of the three vignettes in this package that all give a walkthrough of creating an information table and running the DOMLEM algorithm on them. The datasets covered include:

- The trial dataset
- The global warming dataset
- The warehouse dataset
