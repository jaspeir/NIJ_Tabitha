Type: Package
Title: Dominance-based Rough Set Approach and the DOMLEM Algorithm
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Endre Palatinus
Maintainer: Endre Palatinus <palatinuse@gmail.com>
Description: This package provides functions used in the DRSA, including:
    - Upward and downward class unions
    - P-dominating and P-dominated sets  
    - P-lower and P-upper approximations and boundary regions
    - Upward and downward multi- and mega-unions
    - Decision rules
    - Rule support, certainty, strength, coverage and consistency.
    It supports multiple types of attributes, including indiscernibility, similarity, and dominance.
    The package also provides an implementation of the DOMLEM algorithm for extracting decision rules consistent with the dominance principle.
